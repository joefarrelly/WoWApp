# Boosting App for WoW

## Overview

This is an unfinished app that was created as part of my dissertation in my final module of University. The aim set out in my dissertation was to create an app that could be used by a boosting community in World of Warcraft, in order to manage the day-to-day runnings of said community. The reason I went for this idea was because I was a part of a boosting community and I could see that they were using a Discord server with custom coded bots alongside a very large Google Sheet that combined made up their management system. So I figured, would it not be beneficial to have the features of both of those separate applications in one, and that's why I chose to create this application.

I have attatched the write up of my dissertation in this repo as well if anyone is interested in a look at the whole process from start to finish.
